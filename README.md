## Abstract: 
*Stereo-based depth estimation is a cornerstone of computer vision, with state-of-the-art methods delivering accurate results in real time. For several applications such as autonomous navigation, however, it may be useful to trade accuracy for lower latency. We present Bi3D, a method that estimates depth via a series of binary classifications. Rather than testing if objects are* at *a particular depth D, as existing stereo methods do, it classifies them as being* closer *or* farther *than D. This property offers a powerful mechanism to balance accuracy and latency. Given a strict time budget, Bi3D can detect objects closer than a given distance in as little as a few milliseconds, or estimate depth with arbitrarily coarse quantization, with complexity linear with the number of quantization levels. Bi3D can also use the allotted quantization levels to get continuous depth, but in a specific depth range. For standard stereo (i.e., continuous depth on the whole range), our method is close to or on par with state-of-the-art, finely tuned stereo methods.*

### Description


### Setup

We offer two ways of setting up your environemnt, through Docker or Conda.

#### Docker
For convenience, we provide a Dockerfile to build a container image to run the code. The image will contain the Python dependencies.

System requirements:

1. Docker (Tested on version 19.03.11)

2. [NVIDIA Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki)

3. NVIDIA GPU driver.

Build the container image:
```
docker build -t bi3d . -f envs/bi3d_pytorch_19_01.DockerFile
```
To launch the container, run the following:
```
docker run --rm -it --gpus=all -v $(pwd):/bi3d -w /bi3d --net=host --ipc=host bi3d:latest /bin/bash
```

#### Conda
All dependencies will be installed automatically using the following:
```
conda env create -f envs/bi3d_conda_env.yml 
```
You can activate the environment by running:
```
conda activate bi3d
```

### Pre-trained models
Download the pre-trained models [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X4Ing9WumtIxonNXXCzKJulJtPgzk61n).

### Run the demo

```
cd src
# RUN DEMO FOR SCENEFLOW DATASET 
sh run_demo_sf.sh
# RUN DEMO FOR KITTI15 DATASET
sh run_demo_kitti15.sh
```
